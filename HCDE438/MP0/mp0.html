        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <ul>
          <ol>
            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p>To start this project, I first designed the basic appearance of this website on Figma.</p>
            <img class="hcde438-picture" src="../../imgs/figma.png">
            <p>I did not spend too much time on it as I was not sure how hard it would be to code it out by myself.
              So, I decided to keep this website's design simple and will add more aesthetics later on.
            </p>
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <h4>Basic HTML bones</h4>
            <p>Next is the coding part. I started with HTML since I was more familiar with it.
              Because of my past coding experience, I was not confident in programming.
              I was scared that I could not code what I wanted the website to be like. To solve this problem, I decided to go slower, step by step.
              Make sure that everything in HTML is correct first, and move on to CSS.
            </p>
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <h4>CSS + online resources</h4>
            <p>
              After HTML, it was the most difficult part -- CSS. The reason that stopped me from coding was CSS.
              The work in CSS was too complicated and tedious.
              So I did not really enjoy coding in CSS.
            </p>
            <img class="hcde438-picture" src="../../imgs/bootstrap.png">
            <p>
              However, I searched for some online resources, like Bootstrap, as other classmates recommended, and it helped me a lot.
              It is not difficult to understand at all and it reduced my workload a lot.
              I am glad that I learned how to use Bootstrap, which increased my confidence in coding a little.

        <h3>Issue: Making a Navigation Bar</h3>
        <p>
          I had some trouble on making a navigation bar when I started the CSS part of this project.
          I was not sure about making the buttons horizontal and aligning to the right, while adding my website's name on the top-left corner.
        </p>
        <img class="hcde438-picture" src="../../imgs/issue-navbar.png">
        <p>
          The way I fixed was that -- asking other people. I asked a classmate about making a navigation bar as a starting point to solve the problem.
          She mentioned Bootstrap, a website that I had heard about a lot before but was not sure how to use it.
          So, I went onto Bootstrap and saw there were a lot of examples of code for different components.
          I found the pages for Nav and Navbar components. I looked through the pages and found what I wanted for my navigation bar.
        </p>
        <img class="hcde438-picture" src="../../imgs/bootstrap.png">
        <p>
          I am glad that I was introduced to Bootstrap. Knowing Bootstrap makes my process of coding easier and less stressful.
          I am for sure learning more about this website later on and saving it for my future coding process.

        <h3>CSS Transition</h3>
        <p>
          The first CSS transition I added was the font style. I love a font called Karla because it is clean and easy to read.
          I found the font on Google Fonts first and used the pre-made link from Google Fonts to insert the font into my HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <img class="hcde438-picture" src="../../imgs/font.gif">
        <p>
          The other CSS transition I added was the flexbox feature.
          I hoped to make the sub-pages to be horizontal on my homepage so readers could easily see the contents.
          So, I searched for how to make it work and found Flexbox.
        </p>

        <h3>Ideas and Future</h3>
        <p>
          This is just a basic website without many decorations and aesthetics.
          As the quarter goes on, I will update this website more and add more CSS transitions to make this portfolio looks amazing!
